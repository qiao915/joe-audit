## Dependency Management Recommendations

### Fix Priority Recommendations
<% if (audit.summary.critical > 0) { %>
1. **Fix Critical Vulnerabilities Immediately**：
   - These vulnerabilities may lead to complete system control or data leakage
   - It is recommended to fix all critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
<% } %>
<% if (audit.summary.high > 0) { %>
2. **Fix High Vulnerabilities As Soon As Possible**：
   - These vulnerabilities may lead to important functionality disruption or sensitive information leakage
   - It is recommended to fix all high vulnerabilities within 7 days
<% } %>
<% if (audit.summary.moderate > 0) { %>
3. **Plan to Fix Moderate Vulnerabilities**：
   - These vulnerabilities may be exploited under specific conditions
   - It is recommended to fix all moderate vulnerabilities in the next version update
<% } %>
<% if (audit.summary.low > 0) { %>
4. **Evaluate Fixing Low Vulnerabilities**：
   - These vulnerabilities usually have minor impacts
   - It is recommended to evaluate whether to fix based on the actual project situation

### Dependency Version Management Recommendations

1. **Use Fixed Version Numbers**：
   - Avoid using tilde (~) or caret (^) in package.json to specify versions
   - Using exact version numbers can avoid accidentally introducing vulnerable dependency versions

2. **Update Dependencies Regularly**：
   - Use the `npm outdated` command to check for outdated dependencies
   - Consider using `npm-check-updates` or similar tools to batch update dependencies
   - Regularly updating dependencies can obtain security fixes and performance improvements

3. **Remove Unused Dependencies**：
   - Regularly check and remove dependencies that are no longer used in the project
   - Reducing the number of dependencies can lower security risks and project complexity

4. **Use Dependency Lock Files**：
   - Ensure that the project includes package-lock.json or yarn.lock files
   - Lock files can ensure that team members and deployment environments use the same dependency versions

### Security Audit Recommendations

1. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**：
   - Integrate dependency audits into the continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline
   - Automatically run dependency audits before code submission or deployment

2. **Regular Manual Audits**：
   - It is recommended to regularly run manual dependency audits even if dependencies have not changed
   - New vulnerabilities may be discovered after dependencies are released

3. **Follow Security Announcements**：
   - Follow security announcements and updates for commonly used dependencies
   - Consider using security monitoring services to track the security status of dependencies
